# Responsive Front End Development

In this project, I developed this landing page from scratch by following the design images. I didn't had access to the figma file which made things a bit slower, but I managed to finish the project using the jpg designs. 

## Stack used:

1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. JavaScript

## Learnings

1. Writing code while thinking responsive, and working with media queries
2. Using custom properties to group similar styles including colors and font-sizes
3. Using reusable utility classes to write code faster and in an organized manner
4. Adding comments so that it is easier for other people and myself to make changes and understand the code faster
5. Using appropriate semantic tags for SEO
